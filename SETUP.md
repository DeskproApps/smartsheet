Smartsheet App Setup Instructions
===

To install the Smartsheet app, you must first create an app with a "Client Id" and "Client Secret". Head over to your Smartsheet account to get started.


Once you've logged in, click on the user icon at the bottom left of the screen and choose __"Developer Tools..."__ then click "Create New App".

Give the app a name, description, URL, and contact info - you can fill anything in these fields. Enter your Deskpro URL in the __"App redirect URL"__ field (You can copy this from the Smartsheet settings tab in this admin drawer in Deskpro), then click "Save".

After that, you will see the created app. Copy the "App client id" and "App secret" and keep them safe.

Next, head back to Deskpro and enter the Client id and Secret into the app settings form.

To configure who can see and use the Smartsheet app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
